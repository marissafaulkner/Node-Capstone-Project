<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a practiced procrastinator, I've always found that to do lists are a necessary part of me getting anything done. I wanted to make an app that could benefit procrastinators like me in our effort to actually get things done. Through this endevor I found a technique called Structure Procrastination <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/use-procrastination-to-get-things-done-2014-6">Source</a> <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959">Source</a> and I based my app around this basic idea.</p>
<p>In my app users will get a quick run down on how to procrastinate the smart way, based on the philosophy of Structured Procrastination. Users will be able to add items to their to do lists, breaking them up into daily, weekly, and monthly to dos. From there they can edit and delete, add exactly how long each task will take and their prospective due dates. Lastly, but most importantly, they will be able to star any of there to dos and send it to the top of the list. Having this Very Important Task, the task that triggers their procrastination, at the top of their to do list will (hopefully) propel them into doing everything else on their list.</p>
